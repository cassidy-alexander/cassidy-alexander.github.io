	<h1>Not Enough</h1>
	<h2>UM students face uphill battle with accessibility</h2>
	<h5>By Cassidy Alexander</h5>

			<figcaption>The University of Montana ranks its buildings into three categories: accessibly, limited access and not accessible. Buildings with limited access or that are not accessible may lack features such as elevators, accessible entrances, accessible restrooms, areas or rescue assistance, doorways too narrow to fit wheelchairs, among others. <b>Graphic Cassidy Alexander</b></figcaption>
		</figure>
	<p>Ella Rehder sits at the edge of Arthur Avenue. She positions herself carefully — two wheels on the concrete border and two on the brick pathway, to begin her trek to the Oval, just a few hundred feet away. </p>
	<p>She grips the hand rims on the large wheels of her manual wheelchair and begins to move forward. It’s not easy. Even on perfectly flat, smooth ground, propelling a wheelchair takes precise upper arm strength and balance. </p>
	<p>Now, travelling across the bricks, it’s much more difficult for the 21-year-old. With each slightest turn of the wheels on her chair, she bounces up and down, struggling to grip the rims and push the chair forward. </p>
	<p>She says she can’t make it by herself. Rehder recalls falling, multiple times, out of her chair trying to make it across the bricks alone.</p> 
	<p>Even with the assistance of someone pushing her, it’s tricky. Constantly bumping up and down isn’t exactly comfortable, and if she doesn’t focus on her balance, she says still could fall. </p>
	<p>And once the snow sticks, it’s dramatically worse, Rehder said. Adding ice to the already tricky path can cause wheels to slide and catch in places they hadn’t before. And the slick surface can make it nearly impossible to find the friction necessary to turn the wheels, she added. </p>
	<p>When she can, Rehder avoids the bricks entirely. Doubling or even tripling her travel time across campus is worth it, she says, if she doesn’t have to cross over the bricks.</p>
	<p>These bricks are one of the signature features of the University of Montana campus. The Ryman Mall stretching between Arthur Avenue and the Oval has been there since the ‘60s, and it’s covered in uneven bricks, with a narrow concrete strip bordering it on each side.</p>
	<p>Over five years ago, the University began the planning process for replacing the bricks with something more accessible. </p>
	<p>But since then, the project has been delayed indefinitely.</p> 
	<hr>
	<p>The bricks fall into a gray area of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA requires all public institutions, like the University of Montana, to not discriminate against any particular disability, in short. </p>
	<p>One of the ADA’s stipulations is that accessible floor and ground surfaces must be stable, firm and slip resistant.</p>
	<p>But the ADA doesn’t address overall surface smoothness, said Andree LaRose, who specializes in disability law at Morrison Sherwood Wilson Deola PLLP in Helena. Rough surfaces composed of bricks, like the Ryman Mall, can be “painful to negotiate with wheeled mobility aids due to the vibrations they cause.” But LaRose says this doesn’t mean they’re inherently in violation.</p>
	<p>The ADA does, however, require there not be more than a half-inch change in level between surfaces. There are dozens of spots on the Ryman Mall that have a change in level that exceed a half-inch.</p>
 	<p>In 2014, UM layed three sample panels for public comment in front of the Lommasson Center that could replace the bricks. A University-wide ballot showed students preferred to keep and relay the old bricks instead of replacing them with a concrete pad. Soon after, UM’s student government passed a resolution in support of refurbishing the brick pathway.</p>
	<p>But a year later, the bricks remained unchanged.</p>
	<p>In November 2015, the former UM executive who oversaw the project, Michael Reid, told told the Kaimin the project would cost about $1 million, and would need to be done in installments over the next few years. </p>
	<p>ADA projects like adding an accessible shower to Jesse Hall and adding ADA-compliant seating to Washington-Grizzly Stadium completed by the University from 2000 to 2009 cost about $40,000, on average, according to UM’s 2010 ADA project completion report. </p>
	<p>Facilities Services Director Kevin Kresbach said the bricks do need to be replaced because they’re a hazard for anyone crossing over them, especially students with disabilities.</p>
	<p>But because the expense for replacing the bricks is much higher than other ADA projects, according to Krebsbach, the brick renovation project remains out-of-range for the near future.</p>
	<p>According to the ADA report, other projects, categorized as “major renovations” or “new construction” often exceeded $1 million. UM spent over $116 million in 10 years for other projects like installing ADA elevators in the Skaggs ($14 million) and Math buildings ($1.3 million).</p>
	<p>Jessica Beers, 21, also avoids the bricks however she can. She has a similar strategy for when she does have to cross them: two wheels on the concrete, two wheels on the bricks, two eyes on the path. She says she’s flipped over while trying to cross them, too.</p>
	<p>Beers uses a power chair, which is different from Rehder’s because it doesn’t require her to propel the wheels herself, rather it runs on electricity. This, she says, makes a big difference when it comes to safely navigating a 126-year-old campus.</p>
	<p>But even with the power chair, Beers says avoiding the uneven spots – like the bricks – can make getting from class to class in 10 minutes impossible.</p>
	<p>“For me, it can take an extra 20 minutes to get where everyone else takes five minutes,” Beers said.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Beers was taking a math course on the second floor of the Liberal Arts building when the elevator broke down, making it impossible for her to attend class for over a week-and-a-half. She says her professor found accommodations to move the class to the first floor so she could attend.</p>
	<p>More than 10 multi-story buildings at UM do not have elevators, according the UM’s interactive accessibility map. This map classifies buildings into three categories: accessible, partially accessible or limited access, and inaccessible. Only about half of the buildings on campus are described as fully accessible. </p>
	<p>Elevators are another muddy section of the ADA, LaRose, with Morrison Sherwood Wilson Deola said. The ADA requires an accessible route to connect each story in a facility. That is, unless it falls into an exception. </p>
	<p>Buildings less than three stories or that have less than 3,000 square feet per story do not require elevators. And if the building can be categorized a private facility, like some could be because they’re funded by private funds through the UM Foundation, they are also exempt, LaRose said.</p>
	<p>“You live in a world that’s more built for people who are walking than people with disabilities,” Beers said. “You have to make adaptions to go through your everyday life.”</p>
	<p>Last year, when Rehder registered for spring classes, she was faced with a dilemma: one of the required courses for her major was on the second floor of Rankin Hall, a building without an elevator. </p>
	<p>She ended up enrolling in the class anyway. But on days she relied on her wheelchair – Rehder only uses her chair when she anticipates walking long distances and a cane on the other days – she couldn’t physically get to the classroom. </p>
	<p>“I don’t want to be constantly explaining myself and my needs,” Rehder said. “You shouldn’t have to ask twice.”</p>
	<p>Krebsbach says campus buildings, much like the bricks, lie in the question of whether it’s more important to preserve historical architecture or renovate for accessibility.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Both Beers and Rehder lived in Knowles Hall during their first year of college. Knowles is a partially accessible building, according to the interactive accessibility map. The only fully accessible resident hall is Pantzer Hall, which is only available to second-year students and above. </p>
	<p>Knowles has an accessible entrance and an elevator – but that elevator is not accessible by ADA standards. And the community restrooms are also not accessible.</p> 
	<p>On the first floor of Knowles is a room with a private, accessible restroom and access to a washer and dryer, aside from those in the basement level. Beers lived in this room, without a roommate, because “if there were other people in the room, I wouldn’t physically fit,” Beers said.</p> 
	<p>UM Housing is an auxilliary unit of campus, meaning it operates more like a business rather than receiving money from UM’s general fund.</p>
	<p>Housing Director Sandra Curtis, said that no renovations are possible for residence halls in the near future, including making them more accessible.</p> 
	<p>The ADA was passed in 1990, 27 years after Knowles found it’s place on the edge of campus. And since it, like other residence halls, already existed when the ADA was passed, LaRose  says enforcing that the building become more accessible can be nearly impossible. If the University could make a reasonable argument that making Knowles more accessible would require a great amount of difficulty or money, changes would not have to be made, LaRose added. </p>
	<p>First-year students living in Residence Halls are required to have meal plans. For most students, this means wandering to the Food Zoo in the Emma B. Lommasson Center just across from Knowles Hall, over the bricks. </p>
	<p>The Lommasson Center is considered a fully accessible building at UM. The Food Zoo sits a few steps lower than the first floor, and for students like Beers, is only accessible via a wheelchair lift. </p>
	<p>Beers says she would swipe her Griz Card into the Food Zoo and then wait for one of the UM Dining employees to open the lift. She would pull her chair into the mini-elevator-esque lift, push a button, and slowly be lowered down just a few feet, to the Food Zoo below. The lift, she says, is slow and loud and attention-drawing.</p> 
	<p>The lift is ADA-friendly, but Beers said it wasn’t worth using because it was such a hassle. </p>
	<p>If she wanted to sit with her friends, Beers says she had to rely on them to reserve a table, and even get her food if the buffet-style lines were too busy. </p>
	<p>She went to the Food Zoo twice before upgrading to the All-Campus meal plan, which cost more money than the Lommasson Plus plan she had in 2017. </p>
	<p>“I lost so much independence having to rely on other people,” Beers said. “I didn’t want to do that three times a day, five days a week.”</p>
	<hr>
	<p>There are 1,237 students with disabilities at UM and Missoula College, according to UM’s 2019 Fall Census report. Of these, about 10% struggle with mobility, according to Disability Services for Students Director Amy Capolupo.</p>
	<p>Capolupo says the University has not been focused on making campus more mobility accessible since the ‘90s. </p>
	<p>In May 2012, the Alliance for Disability and Students (ADSUM), a student group, filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education contending the University violated both the ADA of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, citing accessibility issues with technology at the University, particularly Moodle. </p>
	<p>The Office of Civil Rights, under the Department of Education, found the students’ argument to be true, and settled an agreement with UM in March 2014.</p> 
	<p>The agreement required UM to develop new accessibility policies and train employees on disability issues, as well as complete outlined tasks applying to technology. The agreement did not address mobility issues like elevators and the bricks. Meeting the parameters of the agreement was tasked to UM’s ADA coordinator, which is fulfulled by the ADA committee, led by UM lawyer Lucy France.</p> 
	<p>The committee meets once a month, and according to France, is currently focused on addressing any remaining technology accessibility issues that have not yet been resolved since the 2014 settlement with the Department of Education. Some of the improvements include making all University webpages accessible for visually impaired students, training employees to use accessible technology and improving crosswalks. </p>
	<p>Once some of those issues are addressed, it’s possible the committee will refocus to accessibility for people with mobility issues, but there is no firm plan, France said.</p> 
	<p>Krebsbach, who oversees facilities services, is a non-voting member. </p>
	<p>In 2004, the University of Buffalo filed a lawsuit for mobility accessibility issues with the U.S. Department of Education. After the case was settles, UB spent $15.3 million to make the campus more accessible, but students still cite issues with accessible door buttons and being denied entry to campus shuttles, according to UB’s student newspaper.</p> 
	<p>The University of Nevada is posed to spend over $3 million on adding more ADA-compliant seats and wheelchair in Mackay Stadium after an internal audit found the current status of accessibility in the stadium to be insufficient. </p>
	<p>A student is attempting to use a Los Angeles City College lawsuit to improve facilities for visually impaired students at California State University Los Angeles, as of September. Cal State LA’s student paper reported he does not plan on using another lawsuit, but is working with university officials to make positive changes.</p> 
	<p>Krebsbach said regular maintenance projects at the University have been deferred due to budget cuts. When there isn’t enough money to fix broken sidewalks or install sprinklers, there isn’t enough to repave the bricks, he said.</p> 
	<p>The student group that sued UM for lack of accessibility in 2014 is no longer active. ADSUM lacks both a physical space and a director.</p> 
	<p>Former ADSUM director and UM alumna Sylvia Borstad is managing its activities from her home in Columbia Falls, no longer a student, until its future becomes clearer. She says the group was critical for advocating on behalf of disabled students and voicing their needs. </p>
	<p>“They need us (ADSUM) to speak up for people who otherwise wouldn’t be heard,” Borstad said. </p>
	<p>Rehder says she is also frustrated with the lack of options for students with disabilities to voice their concerns to the administration. </p>
	<p>“I can speak up for what I need but not a lot of people can speak up for themselves,” Rehder said. “It needs to be a bigger issue.”</p>
